# Finding Issues with OSS Notify

You've learned the skills — setting up Git, forking repos, making pull requests, and understanding issues. Now it's time to find real open source issues to work on.

Searching through thousands of GitHub repositories manually is overwhelming. [OSS Notify](https://www.ossnotify.com) solves this by matching issues to your skills and delivering them to your inbox.

## What is OSS Notify?

OSS Notify is a service that watches GitHub repositories for new issues and matches them to your skill set. Instead of browsing endlessly, you receive a curated digest of issues you can actually contribute to.

## How It Works

1. **Set your skills** — Tell OSS Notify what languages and frameworks you know (Python, JavaScript, React, Go, etc.)
2. **Watch repositories** — Pick repos you care about or let OSS Notify recommend them
3. **Get matched issues** — Receive email digests with issues filtered to your abilities
4. **Start contributing** — Pick an issue, follow the workflow you learned in these guides, and submit your PR

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up

Go to [ossnotify.com](https://www.ossnotify.com) and sign up with your GitHub account. Setup takes about 2 minutes.

### 2. Configure Your Skills

Select the languages and technologies you're comfortable with. Be honest — it's better to get issues you can actually solve than to be overwhelmed by ones you can't.

If you're just starting out, pick 1-2 languages you know best.

### 3. Watch Repositories

You can:
- **Search** for specific repos you're interested in
- **Browse recommendations** based on your tech stack
- **Discover** popular beginner-friendly projects

### 4. Choose Your Digest Frequency

- **Weekly** (free) — A weekly summary of matching issues
- **Daily** (Pro) — A daily digest so you never miss an opportunity

## Smart Features

- **Label filtering** — Focus on `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or custom labels
- **PR detection** — OSS Notify checks if an issue already has a linked pull request, so you don't waste time on issues already being addressed
- **Skill matching** — Issues are ranked by how well they match your profile

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small** — Look for documentation fixes, typo corrections, or simple bug fixes
2. **Be consistent** — Set aside regular time to check your digest and pick an issue
3. **Follow up** — If you claim an issue, follow through. If you can't finish, let the maintainer know
4. **Level up gradually** — As you gain confidence, expand your skills and watch more repositories
